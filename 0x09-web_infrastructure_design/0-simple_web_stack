Basic Web Stack

Overview
This uncomplicated web infrastructure hosts a website accessible through www.foobar.com. It lacks firewalls or SSL certificates to safeguard the server's network, and resources (CPU, RAM, and SSD) are shared among components like the database and application server.

Key Details About This Setup
Server Definition: A server, whether hardware or software, furnishes services to other computers, commonly referred to as clients.

Domain Name's Role: It offers a human-friendly alias for an IP address, enhancing recognition and recall. For instance, www.wikipedia.org is more user-friendly than 91.198.174.192. This mapping is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS).

DNS Record for www in www.foobar.com: Utilizes an A record, confirmed through the command dig www.foobar.com. Please note that actual results may vary, but in this design, an A record is employed.
A Record (Address Mapping record)—also known as a DNS host record—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.

Web Server's Role: It is a software/hardware that processes requests via HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) and delivers the requested content or an error message.

Application Server's Role: It installs, operates, and hosts applications and services for end users, IT services, and organizations, facilitating the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications.

Database's Role: Maintains an organized collection of information that is easily accessible, managed, and updated.

Client-Server Communication: Communication transpires over the internet network through the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Challenges in This Infrastructure
Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Concerns: Multiple SPOFs exist; for instance, if the MySQL database server fails, the entire site becomes inaccessible.

Downtime During Maintenance: Conducting maintenance checks requires shutting down components or the server. With only one server, this results in website downtime.

Limited Scalability: Scaling proves challenging due to the consolidated components on one server. The server may struggle with resource shortages or slowdowns during periods of high incoming traffic.
