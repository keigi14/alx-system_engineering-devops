Note that as you cannot use interactive software such as emacs or vi in your Bash script, everything needs to be done from the command line (including file edition).

Be sure to read the Docker concept page.

In this first debugging project, you need to get Apache to run on the container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of it.

Example:

vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
...
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
...
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
vagrant@vagrant:~$
After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 returns a page that contains "Hello Holberton." Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
